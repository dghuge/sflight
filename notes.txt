make app deployment ready

command
>cds add hana,mta,xsuaa,approuter --for production

this will add hana module, xsuaaa module 
it will crete mta.yaml file
it will add approuter config to mta.yaml - this is required if you get cannot GET/ error after service is deployed for base service url

add below code in xs-security.json this is configuration for xsuaa and jwt token
  "oauth2-configuration": {
    "token-validity": 9000,
    "redirect-uris": [
      "https://*.cfapps.us10-001.hana.ondemand.com/**"
    ]
  },
  "xsenableasyncservice": "true"

approuter config in mta will point to app/router folder
add xs-app json with authenticationType = xsuaa (case sensitive)

if service is without UI then add below code in package.json under cds
"cds": {
  "fiori": {
    "preview": true
  },
  "server": {
    "index": true
  },
}

login in BAS CLI with command CF login

use command "mbt build -t gen --mtar mta.tar" to build mta file

"cf deploy gen/mta.tar" to deploy


use approuter url to access the service so xsuaa will happen automatically

for destination use srv with client id and secret from  app-auth module -> srv -> view json
check connectivity - 200 success


###Hybrid profile
if you want to run cds watch with HANA and XSUAA
1. use command cds add hana,xsuaa --for hybrid
2. this will add hybrid profile in package.json and cdsrc-private.json 

HANA db will required HDI container instance
use command > cds deploy --to hana:<container_name>
this will create a HDI container in BTP and binding in cdsrc-private.json 

for xsuaa you can use mocked strategy
add below code in cdsrc-private.json
"auth": {
        "kind": "mocked",
        "users": {
          "alice": {
            "password": "password",
            "roles": [
              "processor"
            ]
          }
     },

use command > cds watch --profile hybrid to run in hybrid mode. watch the logs to confirm if its using hana and xsuaa stratgey

cds build --production this will build the project


Typer - used for Typescript
install using 
>cds add typer
>npm install

make sure to add this before adding any cds file since it generates the typer on save.
if files already created then just save them again to generate the Typers
